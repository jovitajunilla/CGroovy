                You are my fire
                The one desire
                Believe when I say
                I want it that way

                But we are two worlds apart
                Can't reach to your heart
                When you say
                That I want it that way

                Tell me why
                Ain't nothin' but a heartache
                Tell me why
                Ain't nothing but a mistake
                Tell me why
                I never wanna hear you say
                I want it that way

                Am I your fire?
                Your one desire
                Yes, I know it's too late
                But I want it that way

                Tell me why
                Ain't nothin' but a heartache
                Tell me why

                Now I can see that we've fallen apart
                From the way that it used to be, yeah
                No matter the distance, I want you to know
                That deep down inside of me
                
                You are my fire
                The one desire
                You are (you are, you are, you are)
                Don't wanna hear you say

                What was I made for?

                Taking a drive
                I was an ideal
                Looked so alive
                Turns out I'm not real
                Just something you paid for

                I don't know how to feel
                But I wanna try
                I don't know how to feel

                Someday, I might

                When did it end?
                All the enjoyment
                I'm sad again
                Don't tell my boyfriend
                It's not what he's made for
                What was I made for?

                I don't know how to feel
                But someday I might
                Someday I might

                Think I forgot
                How to be happy
                Something I'm not
                But something I can be
                Something I wait for
                Something I'm made for
                Something I'm made for`

                People talk (shh) but we don't listen

                Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please

                Anywhere we go, never say no
                Just do it, do it, do it, do it

                You and me and all our friends
                I don't care how much we spend
                Baby, this is what the night is for
                I know nothing's making sense
                For tonight let's just pretend
                I don't wanna stop so give me more

                Midnight memories
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
                Baby, you and me (ayy)
                Stumblin' in the street
                Singin', singin', singin', singin'
                Midnight memories
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
                Anywhere we go, never say no
                Just do it, do it, (yeah) do it, do it`

                Jika terulang, akankah sama?

                Merah bibir kamu, kau pun lirik aku
                Tepat di bawah lampu, kubisikkan kamu
                Apa yang kaumau? Dia atau aku?
                Garam atau madu?

                Hold my hands, don't, don't tell your friends
                Cerita kemaren, kuingat permanen
                Manismu kaya permen, I hope this never end
                Oh, can you be my Gwen? And I'll be the Spiderman

                Sakit dadaku, ku mulai merindu
                Kubayangkan jika kamu tidur di sampingku
                Di malam yang semu, pejamkan mataku
                Kubayangkan tubuhmu jika di pelukanku

                Sakit dadaku, ku mulai merindu
                Kubayangkan jika kamu tidur di sampingku
                Di malam yang semu dan kupejamkan mataku
                Kubayangkan tubuhmu jika di pelukanku

                Malam chaos ini, ku terasa sepi
                Ku tak mau sendiri, I need you here with me
                Aku pilih madu, manis kayak kamu
                Ji, ro, lu

                Wanna tell my friends 'bout you
                Tapi tunggu dulu, ku masih meragu
                Kamu menggebu, wanna be with you
                But jalani dulu, oh
                Wanna be with you

                Sakit dadaku, ku mulai merindu
                Kubayangkan jika kamu tidur di sampingku
                Di malam yang semu, pejamkan mataku
                Kubayangkan tubuhmu jika di pelukanku

                Sakit dadaku, ku mulai merindu
                Kubayangkan jika kamu tidur di sampingku
                Di malam yang semu dan kupejamkan mataku
                Kubayangkan tubuhmu jika di pelukanku

                (Gua Jemsii)

                Yang kumau cuma kamu
                Yang kaumau cuma aku
                Yang kumau cuma kamu
